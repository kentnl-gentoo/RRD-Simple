Version 1.32 - 31rd January 2006
    + No longer set alt-autoscale and alt-y-grid to
      on by default when creating graphs.

    + Changed the graph() method to default the end
      time for the graph to the last time the RRD
      was updated, instead of the current time.


Version 1.31 - 19th January 2006
    + Fixed POD unit tests to run the right tests

    + Added more unit tests.

    + Added retention_period() to exports and documented
      in the POD

    + Bug fix whereby the add_source() wasn't finding
      the best heartbeat (it was returning a source
      name in some internal code instead of the correct
      integer value).

    + Added functionality for the graph() method to check
      what RRA CFs are available before blindly graphing
      the AVERAGE CF type. It will select best of the CFs
      available, in order of preference, AVERAGE, MAX,
      MIN, LAST.

    + Added (undocumented) "cf" parameter inside the
      new() method to specify which CFs to use when creating
      RRAs in a new RRD file. This may be documented later
      if it's considered useful, and if the paramrter
      name is correct (ie, shouldn't be named something
      else), or implemented in another way.

    + Fixed a bug which (until this release) would not
      and should not have been noticed since it only
      effected the passing of default values to the
      RRD::Simple $self object when used with indirect
      method calls requiring the new "cf" paramater.


Version 1.30 - 15th January 2006
    + Removed notice about add_source() not working with
      latest versions of RRD from the POD.

    + Added Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage unit tests

    + The graph() method now allows arrays to be passed
      as key value options, thus allowing many --colour
      values to be set

    + Added the "source_colors" parameter to the graph()
      method to specify the plotted data source line colours

    + Added the "source_labels" parameter to the graph()
      method to specify data source labels in the legend/key

    + Changed the add_source() method to try and use
      the RRDs module for all the needed rrdtool
      functionality, instead of having to spawn an external
      copy of the rrdtool binary. A patch submitted to
      Tobi on 2006/01/08 which should be available in the
      1.2.13 release of rrdtool will allow RRDs::dump to
      dump to a filename instead of STDOUT, this removing
      the need for RRD::Simple to use the rrdtool binary
      at all.

    + Tweaked POD a little

    + Fixed some typos in the code where "3year" and "3years"
      were being mixed up. They have all been changed to be
      "3years" now, as per the POD.

    + Added the retention_period() method to return (in 
      seconds) how long the RRD will store data for.

    + The graph() method will now only generate graphs which
      the RRD file has enough data for. (ie, a 1 week long
      RRD file will not try and generate a 3 year graph etc)

    + Fixed a bug whereby the create() method and the graph()
      method were both getting the same values back from the
      _seconds_in() function, which should not be the case.
      This was resulting in blocky graphs because there was
      not enough margin between RRA boundies to ensure that
      each graph was getting the highest resolution data that
      you would expect. Also, _seconds_in() was returning
      slightly too high values, which indirectly caused the
      X asis labels to overlap eachother in some instances.


Version 1.29 - 6th January 2006
    + Improved makefile version extraction.

    + Changed license to Apache 2.0
      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

    + Changed escaping on date in graph() to only happen
      with RRDs version 1.2 or greater (escaping should not
      be used with version 1.0)

    + Changed how the last values are pulled from the RRA
      in the last_values() method so it's more reliable
      now.

    + Fixed add_source() to work with rrdtool 1.2x and RRD
      version 0003 files.

    + Added /usr/local/rrdtool*/bin/ to the search path
      when looking for the rrdtool binary.

    + Tweaked Makefile.PL


Version 1.25 - 28th December 2005
    + Added Changes file.

    + Changed cluck warnings to only be output when perl
      warnings are enabled ($^W is set true).

    + t/04lazy_create_by_update.t
      t/07correct_spelling.t
      -- Disabled warnings being output for some unit tests
         so as not to alarm people. (The warnings are
         intentional when $^W is true, so it is deliberately
         set to false for those tests).

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.


Version 1.24 - 26th December 2005
    + Added explicit specification of a data retention
      period (internally to RRD::Simple called a scheme).

    + Added checking of RRD file versions before
      attempting to add a new data source to an existing
      RRD file. add_source() can only be used on RRD
      version 001 files at the moment (rrdtool version
      1.0.x). Unit tests have been updated to take this
      in to account and skip if necessary.

    + Tidied and improved some of the error messages that
      are returned if the addition of a new data source
      to an existing RRD file fails.

    + Fixed escaping of the time date stamp that is added
      to the graphs so that it is compatible with rrdtool
      version 1.2.x.

    + Altered parsing of arguments to the graph() method
      so that _ characters are converted to - characters
      before passing to the RRDs module. This negated the
      need to quote a number or arguments that are passed
      in to the graph() method.

    + Added some more comments in the code.

    + Added some more POD.


Version 1.21 - 14th December 2005
    + Added examples/ApacheAccessLogActivity.pl
      -- Example script to import apache access log
         files in to a simple RRD file for graphing

    + Fixed a bug in the update() method to allow explicit
      specification of data insertion time. Previously if no
      RRD file was specified, the explicitly specified
      insertion time would have incorrectly been used as the
      RRD filename.

    + Added an experimental last_values() method to return
      the last values stored in the LAST CF RRA. This is not
      currently documented because it does not function as
      you would logically expect.

    + Added t/09last_value.t
      -- This test is essentially skipped because the output
         is not as you might expect. It will be enabled once
         the last_values() method is working better.

    + Added the 'basename' argument to the graph() method.

    + Added the 'sources' argument to the graph() method.

    + Fixed a few minor typos in warning messages.

    + Added more POD.

    + Improved unit tests.
