Version 1.29 - 6th January 2006
    + Improved makefile version extraction.

    + Changed license to Apache 2.0
      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

    + Changed escaping on date in graph() to only happen
      with RRDs version 1.2 or greater (escaping should not
      be used with version 1.0)

    + Changed how the last values are pulled from the RRA
      in the last_values() method so it's more reliable
      now.

    + Fixed add_source() to work with rrdtool 1.2x and RRD
      version 0003 files.

    + Added /usr/local/rrdtool*/bin/ to the search path
      when looking for the rrdtool binary.

    + Tweaked Makefile.PL


Version 1.25 - 28th December 2005
    + Added Changes file.

    + Changed cluck warnings to only be output when perl
      warnings are enabled ($^W is set true).

    + t/04lazy_create_by_update.t
      t/07correct_spelling.t
      -- Disabled warnings being output for some unit tests
         so as not to alarm people. (The warnings are
         intentional when $^W is true, so it is deliberately
         set to false for those tests).

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.


Version 1.24 - 26th December 2005
    + Added explicit specification of a data retention
      period (internally to RRD::Simple called a scheme).

    + Added checking of RRD file versions before
      attempting to add a new data source to an existing
      RRD file. add_source() can only be used on RRD
      version 001 files at the moment (rrdtool version
      1.0.x). Unit tests have been updated to take this
      in to account and skip if necessary.

    + Tidied and improved some of the error messages that
      are returned if the addition of a new data source
      to an existing RRD file fails.

    + Fixed escaping of the time date stamp that is added
      to the graphs so that it is compatible with rrdtool
      version 1.2.x.

    + Altered parsing of arguments to the graph() method
      so that _ characters are converted to - characters
      before passing to the RRDs module. This negated the
      need to quote a number or arguments that are passed
      in to the graph() method.

    + Added some more comments in the code.

    + Added some more POD.


Version 1.21 - 14th December 2005
    + Added examples/ApacheAccessLogActivity.pl
      -- Example script to import apache access log
         files in to a simple RRD file for graphing

    + Fixed a bug in the update() method to allow explicit
      specification of data insertion time. Previously if no
      RRD file was specified, the explicitly specified
      insertion time would have incorrectly been used as the
      RRD filename.

    + Added an experimental last_values() method to return
      the last values stored in the LAST CF RRA. This is not
      currently documented because it does not function as
      you would logically expect.

    + Added t/09last_value.t
      -- This test is essentially skipped because the output
         is not as you might expect. It will be enabled once
         the last_values() method is working better.

    + Added the 'basename' argument to the graph() method.

    + Added the 'sources' argument to the graph() method.

    + Fixed a few minor typos in warning messages.

    + Added more POD.

    + Improved unit tests.
