Installing RRDtool
==================

RRD::Simple requires the RRDs module (a part of RRDtool) to
be available in the Perl @INC path. RRDtool can be downloaded
from http://www.rrdtool.org or http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/.

In RRDTool version 1.0.x, the RRDs module is located in the
"rrdtool-1.0.xx/perl-shared/" directory. In version 1.2.x, it
is located in "rrdtool-1.2.xx/bindings/perl-shared/".

	tar -zxf rrdtool-1.x.xx.tar.gz
	cd rrdtool-1.x.xx
	./configure && make && make install
	# cd perl-shared        # Version 1.0.x
	cd bindings/perl-shared # Version 1.2.x
	make clean
	perl Makefile.PL && make && make install

Debian users may need to explicitly install the RRDs package
as well as the RRDtool and librrd package.
