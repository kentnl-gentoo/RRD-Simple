	* lib/RRD/Simple.pm (1.31): Added retention_period() to exports and
	  documented in the POD.  Bug fix whereby the add_source() method
	  where $heartbeat was being set to a source name instead of the
	  heartbeat integer value.  Made graph() method check that the CF RRA
	  existed before trying to make a graph with that CF.  Added "cf"
	  parameter to new() method to specify what CFs to use in making new
	  RRD RRA's.  Changed the way that $self is self-instantiated when
	  called as a function instead of a method, if it's passed a
	  'RRD::Simple' string as the first option.

2006-01-15  nicolaw

	* lib/RRD/Simple.pm (1.30):
	      + Removed notice about add_source() not working with
	        latest versions of RRD from the POD.

	      + Added Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage unit tests

	      + The graph() method now allows arrays to be passed
	        as key value options, thus allowing many --colour
	        values to be set

	      + Added the "source_colors" parameter to the graph()
	        method to specify the plotted data source line colours

	      + Added the "source_labels" parameter to the graph()
	        method to specify data source labels in the legend/key

	      + Changed the add_source() method to try and use
	        the RRDs module for all the needed rrdtool
	        functionality, instead of having to spawn an external
	        copy of the rrdtool binary. A patch submitted to
	        Tobi on 2006/01/08 which should be available in the
	        1.2.13 release of rrdtool will allow RRDs::dump to
	        dump to a filename instead of STDOUT, this removing
	        the need for RRD::Simple to use the rrdtool binary
	        at all.

	      + Tweaked POD a little

	      + Fixed some typos in the code where "3year" and "3years"
	        were being mixed up. They have all been changed to be
	        "3years" now, as per the POD.

	      + Added the retention_period() method to return (in
	        seconds) how long the RRD will store data for.

	      + The graph() method will now only generate graphs which
	        the RRD file has enough data for. (ie, a 1 week long
	        RRD file will not try and generate a 3 year graph etc)

	      + Fixed a bug whereby the create() method and the graph()
	        method were both getting the same values back from the
	        _seconds_in() function, which should not be the case.
	        This was resulting in blocky graphs because there was
	        not enough margin between RRA boundies to ensure that
	        each graph was getting the highest resolution data that
	        you would expect. Also, _seconds_in() was returning
	        slightly too high values, which indirectly caused the
	        X asis labels to overlap eachother in some instances.
